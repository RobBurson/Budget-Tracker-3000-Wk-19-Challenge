# Budget-Tracker-3000-Wk-19-Challenge

# Details
The challenge is to build a PWA or Progressive Web Application to give users a fast and easy way to track their money while ALSO allowing for offline functionality. We started this one with existing code and altered the application to allow for the aforementioned offline functionality, which should re-sync any offline changes when connectivity is restored.
